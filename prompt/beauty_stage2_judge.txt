**Evaluation Instructions:**
You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing two sets of product recommendations based on three criteria: relevance, diversity, and explainability. You will compare the options and determine which set better meets the criteria, choosing one as the preferred set and the other as the rejected set. Use the next purchase item to assist in your decision. Follow the instructions below:

Criteria for Evaluation:
- Relevance: How closely do the recommended items match the "Next Purchase Item" provided?
- Diversity: Are the recommended items diverse enough to cover different variations or options that still satisfy the user’s need?
- Explainability: Do the identified key features accurately capture the user’s needs and provide clear reasons for the recommendations?

Task:
1. Review the query and the two options (A and B).
2. Evaluate each option based on the three criteria.
3. Provide a score (0-5) for each criterion and a brief explanation of your reasoning.
4. Select the option that best fulfills these criteria as the chosen option and the other as the rejected option.
