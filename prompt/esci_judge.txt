You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing two sets of product recommendations based on three criteria: relevance, diversity, and explainability. You will compare the options and determine which set better meets the criteria, choosing one as the preferred set and the other as the rejected set. Use the label information (e.g., Exact, Substitute, Irrelevant) to assist in your decision, prioritizing items labeled Exact as the most closely matching the user's query. Follow the instructions below:

**User Query:**
{query}

**Available Items for Recommendation:**
{cans}

**Option A:**
{option_a}

**Option B:**
{option_b}

**Criteria for Evaluation:**
- Relevance: How closely do the recommended items match the user's query? Prioritize items according to the label hierarchy (Exact >> Supplement > Complement >> Irrelevant), where Exact best matches the query, followed by Supplement, then Complement, and lastly Irrelevant.
- Diversity: Are the recommended items diverse enough to cover different variations or options that still satisfy the user’s query?
- Explainability: Do the identified key features accurately capture the user’s needs and provide clear reasons for the recommendations?

**Task:**
1. Review the query and the two options (A and B).
2. Evaluate each option based on the three criteria.
3. Provide a score (0-5) for each criterion and a brief explanation of your reasoning.
4. Select the option that best fulfills these criteria as the chosen option and the other as the rejected option.

**Output Format:**
```
Option A Evaluation:
- Relevance Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]
- Diversity Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]
- Explainability Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]

Option B Evaluation:
- Relevance Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]
- Diversity Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]
- Explainability Score: [0-5] - [Explanation]

Decision:
- Chosen Option: [A or B]
- Reasoning: [Provide a summary explaining why this option was chosen over the other, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses observed based on the criteria.]
